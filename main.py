# These examples directly teach the LLM the desired output format and style.
# The citation format is used within the example answers to simulate document referencing.
# The actual source document page numbers are manually added for demonstration.
# IMPORTANT: The actual citations will depend on the RAG system's ability to extract metadata,
# which the current setup (return_source_documents=False for simplicity) doesn't directly expose
# to the LLM for generation in the string answer. For true dynamic citations, a more complex
# chain that processes source_documents from RetrievalQA.invoke is needed.
# For this prompt, the citations are illustrative of the desired *style*.
